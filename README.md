# WHISPERER

GraphQL API powering the Whisperer application where you can share your thoughts anonymously.

It's based on two NPM libraries:

*apollo-server* is the core library for Apollo Server itself, which helps you define the shape of your data and how to fetch it.

*graphql* is the library used to build a GraphQL schema and execute queries against it.
